- [Cyber L2](/cyber-l2): Cyber is a Layer 2 blockchain embedding social dynamics into onchain experiences with a suite of AI products to make crypto more accessible and engaging for everyone. As an EVM chain, Cyber does not limit use cases only to social networks. EVM-based applications can run on Cyber without modifications.
- [FAQs](/faq): Cyber, as an EVM-equivalent L2, does not limit use cases only to social networks. Existing EVM-based applications can run on Cyber without modifications.
- [Techincal Support](/support): Welcome to the Cyber L2 support page. If you're facing any issues or have questions regarding Cyber L2, our team and community are here to help.
- [Features](/cyber-id/features): Safe and Simple Identity Management:
- [Overview](/cyber-id/overview): CyberID is the naming system used on the Cyber blockchain. It links personalized, human-readable usernames to addresses on the Cyber Mainnet.
- [Query CyberID Holdings](/cyber-id/query-holdings): In CyberWallet, the CyberID is minted to the CyberAccount address owning by the EOA wallet. However, the CyberID can be transferred to another EOA/CyberAccount address. So when querying the CyberID holdings, we need to query the CyberAccount address and the EOA wallet address. Here is an example of how to query the CyberID holdings.

- [What is a Delegate?](/governance/delegate-overview): Participation in CyberDAO governance may require a significant time commitment. For this reason, members may delegate the voting power of their staked CYBER tokens to a community member who has volunteered to actively participate in governance. A **delegate** is such a volunteer and a member of the Cyber community who has been elected to represent other token holders and make governance decisions on their behalf. Delegates are elected by token holders granting them their voting power. Only delegates can participate in voting.
