# Getting Started

CyberWallet SDK is a collection of tools that allow developers to integrate [CyberWallet](https://passkey.cyber.co) into their dapps. The SDK provides a simple and secure way to connect to [CyberWallet](https://passkey.cyber.co) and interact with the Cyber mainnet.

## Preparation

Before starting, you need to go to the [Cyber Developer Center](https://dashboard.cyberconnect.me) to create a project and get your project ID.

## Thrid-party Library Integration

CyberWallet SDK supports integration with the following libraries:

* [Viem](/cyberwallet/sdk/viem)
* [Wagmi](/cyberwallet/sdk/wagmi)
* [RainbowKit](/cyberwallet/sdk/rainbowkit)
* [Ethers](/cyberwallet/sdk/ethers)
* [Web3.js](/cyberwallet/sdk/web3-js)

## Singature Validation

When signing messages with CyberWallet, the signature format will be different depending on whether the account has been deployed.

If the account has not been deployed, the signature will be wrapped in [ERC-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492) format, you'll need to validate the signature following the [ERC-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492) standard. For deployed accounts, follow the [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) standard.
