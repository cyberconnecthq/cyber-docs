## What are passkeys?
    1. **Simplified Security**: Passkeys offer a more secure and user-friendly alternative to passwords and recovery phrases. They enable sign-ins using just your fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock.
    2. **Enhanced Protection**: Stored locally on your device, passkeys cannot be guessed or reused, ensuring your information remains secure against attackers.
    3. **Widespread Adoption**: Many leading products, such as Amazon, PayPal, and eBay, as well as web3 giant like Binance and OKX, are now supporting passkeys.
