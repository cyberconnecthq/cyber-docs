# CyberID Overview

## What is CyberID?

Much like your username on Instagram or X, CyberID is an ERC-721 token that represents a unique handle for your account in the CyberConnect social network. Registering a CyberID requires a one-time fee, and once registered, you can trade your CyberID with other users.
