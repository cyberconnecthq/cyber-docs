# Overview

- CyberID is the naming system used on the Cyber blockchain. It links personalized, human-readable usernames to addresses on the Cyber Mainnet.
- CyberID serves as your unique identity within the Cyber ecosystem. It is a tradable ERC-721 NFT with a unique handle for naming addresses on Cyber. It makes it easier and more fun to connect with others and build your onchain reputation.
- CyberID was previously deployed on OP Mainnet but is being migrated to Cyber Mainnet as part of an upgrade. After the upgrade, CyberID can now be owned by any EOA address. ***In the new CyberWallet currently in development, CyberID will play an important role in unifying a user’s onchain identity directly within the wallet, further simplifying the user experience.***

At Cyber, we aim to make web3 more social, meaning it's both fun and easy to connect with others onchain. CyberID is a key part of this vision, as it simplifies onchain interactions for users. Similar to a username on Instagram or X, CyberID provides a unique handle for your account in the Cyber ecosystem.

Beyond being an identifier, CyberID represents your identity and adds context to your onchain presence. It acts as a user-friendly alias for your blockchain addresses, making it easier to build your reputation and connect with others in the Cyber ecosystem.

If you’ve been in web3 for a while, you’re likely familiar with interacting with wallet addresses, but even experienced users find it frustrating. If you've ever double or triple-checked a recipient address before sending a transaction, you know how tricky managing long strings of numbers and text can be. CyberID simplifies this by replacing these long strings with easy-to-remember usernames, making it easier for others to interact with you and send transactions.

The [cyber.co](http://cyber.co/) website and popular native apps, like cyberscan.co and Link3 will support CyberID at launch. In the future, all apps on Cyber will support CyberID. Secure your CyberID now to start building your onchain reputation.

CyberID is currently being migrated to the Cyber chain from OP Mainnet, and existing CyberID holders can migrate their IDs free of charge (except for gas fees). Starting on September 23, 2024, existing users can migrate to Cyber Mainnet, and new CyberIDs will be available for purchase. All existing CyberIDs will retain their rights and name displays.

Registering a CyberID requires a one-time fee, and once registered, you can trade your CyberID with other users.
