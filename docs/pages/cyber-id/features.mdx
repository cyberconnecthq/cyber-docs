1. Safe and Simple Identity Management:
    - In Web3, many users manage multiple wallets or switch between them. CyberID is transferable, allowing you to carry your identity and reputation with you when you change wallets. Building your onchain reputation takes time and effort, and with CyberID, you can preserve this valuable asset.
2. ENS Compatible:
    - CyberID is compatible with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). If you're familiar with sending funds to an ENS handle like **`ryan.eth`**, you can now do the same with a CyberID handle, with a minor modification. On ENS-compatible web3 applications, you can send funds to **`ryan.cyber.id`**, and CyberID will handle the rest.
3. Create your own Subdomains:
    - With CyberID, you don't just get a handle; you also own a unique domain on Cyber. For example, if you own **`ryan.cyber`**, it's not just a handle â€” it's a digital realm under your control. As the owner of a **`.cyber`** handle, you can generate as many subdomains as you like, following the format **`nft.ryan.cyber`** under the primary **`ryan.cyber`** domain.
