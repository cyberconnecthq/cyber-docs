# Overview

Welcome to the Cyber developer documentation. This page gives you a high-level overview of the three pillars you will interact with most often:

- **Cyber L2** – an Ethereum Layer 2 designed for social applications and AI
- **Cyber AI** – a crypto-specific AI model and API suite
- **CYBER token** – the utility and governance token that powers the ecosystem

Throughout the documentation are resources which you can copy & paste for easy use.

## 1. Cyber L2

Cyber is an OP-stack Layer 2 that brings social primitives onchain. Because it is fully EVM compatible, any Solidity-based contract or tool that works on Ethereum will run on Cyber.

- **Built by the CyberConnect team** – a team with a track record of building consumer applications and scalable decentralized infrastructure.
- **Modular OP Stack** – modular and interoperable.
- **Focus on UX** – low fees, fast finality, and social features built in.

## 2. Cyber AI

Cyber AI is a domain-focused AI model that combines onchain data with off-chain intelligence. It is g**rounded, not generic** and trained only on crypto data sets. Cyber AI can be used to build agents, dashboards, or products that require reliable crypto answers and data. The [Surf co-pilot](https://www.notion.so/Surf-AI-Co-Pilot-Messaging-1b20c7ec751f80659e2ece476eac402f?pvs=21) application runs on the same APIs you can access, so every capability you see in Surf is reproducible in your own stack.

## 3. CYBER Token

CYBER is a multichain OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) that serves as the network’s utility and governance token. It has a total supply of **100 million.** CYBER holders can stake their tokens to participate in on-chain governance, secure the network, and earn rewards while receiving staking tokens called cCYBER or stCYBER.
