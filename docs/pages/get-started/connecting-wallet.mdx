1. **Open MetaMask**  
   Make sure that MetaMask is installed in your browser and you are logged in.

2. **Access Settings**  
   Click on the MetaMask extension icon and then click on your account icon in the top-right corner. From the dropdown menu, select **Settings**.

3. **Add Network**  
   In the Settings menu, select **Networks** and then click **Add a network**.

| Name            | Testnet                               | Mainnet                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Network Name    | Cyber Testnet                         | Cyber                         |

5. **Save the Network**

6. **Switch Network**  
   To switch to the Cyber network, click on the network dropdown at the top of MetaMask and select **Cyber**.

7. **Adjust Gas Price**
   There is [a bug for MetaMask](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/24236) users that causes the gas price to be set too high. To avoid this, you can set the gas price manually by clicking on the **Estimated fee** button in the transaction confirmation window.

   - Check the **Save values** checkbox.
