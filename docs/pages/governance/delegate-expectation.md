## Delegate Best Practices

Before deciding to become a delegate, it's crucial to understand the responsibilities and expectations associated with the role. Review the following guidelines to ensure that you are fully prepared to serve as a delegate for the Cyber community:

1. **Understand the Responsibilities**: Delegates are expected to actively participate in the decision-making process and to act in the best interests of the network. Familiarize yourself with the Cyber community guidelines and governance documents.
2. **Review Key Documents**: Ensure you have read Cyber’s goals and visions around the future of the decentralized social and internet, such that you’re both aligned and excited by it! These documents will include the constitution, the docs, the community vision, and the governance roadmap laid out by the Foundation and community that is core to the mission of Cyber.
3. **Create your Delegate Statement**: Create a delegate profile to outline your qualifications, experience, and vision for the Cyber. Your profile will be displayed on [`gov.cyber.co`](https://gov.cyber.co/) and will allow community members to delegate their voting power to you.
4. **Prepared to Engage Openly and Continuously**: Becoming an active and engaged delegate requires a time commitment as well. You should expect to stay abreast of all the Cyber developments and community changes over time and help guide the community toward its future vision as the ecosystem evolves.
5. **Seek Support and Clarification**: If you have any questions or need further clarification on your role or responsibilities, do not hesitate to visit the Cyber governance forum (forum.cyber.co) or join us on Discord to ask!
