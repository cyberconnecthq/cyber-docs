# Cyber Ecosystem Grants

The [Cyber Ecosystem Grants](https://app.charmverse.io/cyber-ecosystem-grants/) program has been set up with a dedicated $2M in CYBER tokens to support builders in developing a vibrant ecosystem and fostering more social and engaging experiences within web3. 

This program is managed by an initial Grants Council consisting of five members and a program manager from [CharmVerse](https://charmverse.io/). All grant proposals will follow a separate process different than those described above.

Specialized councils, composed of high-context delegates, are formed to streamline processes and make informed judgments. The first council established was the [Grants Council](https://app.charmverse.io/cyber-ecosystem-grants/) which aims to accelerate the ecosystem's growth and attract high-quality builders.
