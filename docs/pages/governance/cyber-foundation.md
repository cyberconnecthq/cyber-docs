# The Cyber Foundation

The Cyber Foundation is a Cayman Islands foundation company. It operates to support the establishment of CyberDAO. 

Consistent with CyberDAO’s Working Constitution, the Foundation strives to:

- Support the DAO with a formal legal entity.
- Steward the early evolution of DAO governance.

### Supporting the DAO through a formal legal entity

As an established entity (a Cayman foundation company), the Cyber Foundation can enter into legally enforceable, binding commitments with third parties in the “real” world on a limited liability basis. For example, the Foundation is able to:

- Enter into contracts with third parties, such as service providers.
- Administer intellectual property rights.
- Make required governmental reports and filings.

### Stewarding the early evolution of Collective self-governance

In its stewardship role, the Cyber Foundation currently facilitates a number of administrative aspects of Collective governance. For instance, it:

- Monitors and moderates governance proposal processes.
- Implements approved governance proposals.
- Helps develop frameworks, such as the Working Constitution and the Operating Manual, to facilitate participation.

The Foundation will not provide these administrative services indefinitely; its ultimate aim is to coordinate contributors into creating the technical and governance foundations that allow the Foundation to decentralize its role over time. Decentralization proposals that gradually phase out the foundation’s involvement will be raised within the first year after this constitution comes to effect.
