# CyberWallet Overview

## What is CyberWallet?

CyberWallet is an ERC-4337-compatible multi-chain smart contract wallet. As the users all-in-one social account and wallet in web3, it enables a range of advanced features, including:

- **Sponsored Gas Costs**: It provides users with the ability to pay for others' gas costs or delegate payment to a third party.
- **Account Recovery**: To avoid losing your account in cases when the private key or seed phrase can't be recovered, account security can be distributed among trusted entities or devices.
- **Batch Transactions**: Account abstraction makes it possible for users to make multiple calls within a single user operation, significantly improving the UX of web3 dApps.
- **Customizable Security**: Users can set up flexible security rules like 2FA/MFA or biometric login to suit that needs.
- **Use Gas Across Chains**: Use your gas credit on one blockchain to complete a transaction on another. Example: Pay for a transaction on Optimism with Matic and on Polygon with BNB.
