## Cyber AI Overview

Cyber AI is a specialized AI model built to navigate the crypto space’s fast-moving data and complexities. It pulls information from reliable sources—including CoinGecko, RootData, Snapshot, hundreds of thousands of crypto X accounts, and more—to deliver clear, context-aware answers. It combines both onchain and offchain datapoints to create a comprehensive AI model that actually understands crypto.

### Cyber AI’s Design Principles

- **Grounded, not generic**
    
    Trained exclusively on crypto data, Cyber AI ignores unrelated topics like weather reports or sports scores. This allows it to have unprecedented accuracy for crypto inquiries.
    
- **Freshness by default**
    
    New crypto data is constantly indexed, so you don’t have to maintain your own data pipelines.
    

### When to Use Cyber AI

- Creating agents, dashboards, or products that need consistent answers or insights from scattered crypto data.
- Powering real-time alerts for various crypto use cases.
